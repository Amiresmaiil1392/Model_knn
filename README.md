# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification on Iris Dataset

## Introduction
This project implements a K-Nearest Neighbors classifier to predict iris flower species based on their sepal and petal measurements. The Iris dataset is a classic benchmark in machine learning, containing three species of iris flowers (setosa, versicolor, and virginica) with four features each.

## Dataset Overview
The Iris dataset contains 150 samples with the following features:
- Sepal length (cm)
- Sepal width (cm)
- Petal length (cm)
- Petal width (cm)

Target classes:
- Iris-setosa
- Iris-versicolor
- Iris-virginica

## K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm
KNN is a simple yet powerful instance-based learning algorithm that works by finding the K most similar training examples (neighbors) to a new data point and predicting the majority class among them.

### Key Characteristics:
1. **Lazy Learner**: Doesn't build a model during training, just stores the dataset
2. **Distance-Based**: Uses distance metrics (usually Euclidean) to find nearest neighbors
3. **Hyperparameter K**: The number of neighbors to consider (critical for performance)

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Loaded the dataset using scikit-learn's built-in function
- Split the data into features (X) and target (y)
- Performed train-test split (80% train, 20% test)
- Standardized features using StandardScaler for equal feature contribution

### 2. Model Training
- Initialized the KNN classifier with K=3 (chosen after experimentation)
- Fit the model on the training data (no actual "training" occurs, just data storage)

### 3. Model Evaluation
- Made predictions on the test set
- Calculated accuracy score (typically achieves 95-100% on this dataset)
- Generated a classification report showing precision, recall, and f1-score
- Created a confusion matrix to visualize performance

### 4. Hyperparameter Tuning
- Tested various K values (1 through 20) using cross-validation
- Plotted accuracy vs. K to find the optimal value
- Observed that very low K leads to overfitting, high K to underfitting

## Key Findings
- The model achieves excellent performance on this dataset (often 95-100% accuracy)
- Setosa is perfectly separable, while versicolor and virginica have some overlap
- Petal measurements are more discriminative than sepal measurements
- Optimal K value typically falls between 3-7 for this dataset
